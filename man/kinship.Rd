Relatedness based on pedigree or marker data
}
\description{
This function implements different measures of relatedness between individuals in an object of class \code{gpData}: (1) Expected relatedness based on pedigree and (2) realized relatedness based on marker data. See 'Details'.  The function uses as first argument an object of class \code{gpData}. An argument \code{ret} controls the type of relatedness coefficient.

\bold{Pedigree based relatedness (return arguments \code{"add"}, \code{"kin"}, \code{"dom"}, and \code{"gam"})}

Function \code{kin} provides different types of measures for pedigree based relatedness. An element \code{pedigree} must be available in the object of class \code{gpData}. In all cases, the first step is to build the gametic relationship. The gametic relationship is of order 2\eqn{n} as each individual has two alleles (e.g. individual \eqn{A} has alleles \eqn{A1} and \eqn{A2}). The gametic relationship
is defined as the matrix of probabilities that two alleles are identical by descent (IBD).  Note that the diagonal elements of the gametic relationship matrix are 1. The off-diagonals of individuals with unknown or unrelated parents in the pedigree are 0. If \code{ret="gam"} is specified, the gametic relationship matrix constructed by pedigree is returned.

The gametic relationship matrix can be used to construct other types of relationship matrices. If \code{ret="add"}, the additive numerator relationship matrix is returned. The additive relationship of individuals A (alleles \eqn{A1,A2}) and B (alleles \eqn{B1,B2}) is given by  the entries of the gametic relationship matrix
\deqn{0.5\cdot \left[(A1,B1) + (A1,B2) + (A2,B1) + (A2,B2)\right],}{0.5*[(A1,B1) + (A1,B2) + (A2,B1) + (A2,B2)],}
where \eqn{(A1,B1)} denotes the element [A1,B1] in the gametic relationship matrix. If \code{ret="kin"}, the kinship matrix is returned which is half of the additive relationship matrix.

If \code{ret="dom"}, the dominance relationship matrix is returned. The dominance relationship matrix between individuals A (\eqn{A1,A2}) and B (\eqn{B1,B2}) in case of no inbreeding is given by
\deqn{\left[(A1,B1) \cdot (A2,B2) + (A1,B2) \cdot (A2,B1)\right],}{[(A1,B1) * (A2,B2) + (A1,B2) * (A2,B1)],}
where \eqn{(A1,C1)} denotes the element [A1,C1] in the gametic relationship matrix.

\bold{Marker based relatedness (return arguments \code{"realized"},\code{"realizedAB"}, \code{"sm"}, and \code{"sm-smin"})}

Function \code{kin} provides different types of measures for marker based relatedness. An element \code{geno} must be available in the object of class \code{gpData}. Furthermore, genotypes must be coded by the number of copies of the minor allele, i.e. function \code{codeGeno} must be applied in advance.

If \code{ret="realized"}, the realized relatedness between individuals is computed according to the formulas in Habier et al. (2007) or vanRaden (2008)
\deqn{U = \frac{ZZ'}{2\sum p_i(1-p_i)}}{ZZ'/(2\sum pi(1-pi))} where \eqn{Z=W-P}, \eqn{W} is the marker matrix, \eqn{P} contains the allele frequencies multiplied by 2, \eqn{p_i}{pi} is the allele frequency of marker \eqn{i}, and the sum is over all loci.

If \code{ret="realizedAB"}, the realized relatedness between individuals is computed according to the formula in Astle and Balding (2009)
\deqn{U = \frac{1}{M} \sum \frac{(w_i-2p_i)(w_i-2p_i)'}{2p_i(1-p_i)}}{1/M sum((wi-2pi)(wi-2pi)'/(2pi(1-pi)))} where \eqn{w_i}{wi} is the marker genotype, \eqn{p_i}{pi} is the allele frequency at marker locus \eqn{i}, and \eqn{M} is the number of marker loci, and the sum is over all loci.

If \code{ret="sm"}, the realized relatedness between individuals is computed according to the simple
matching coefficient (Reif et al. 2005). The simple matching coefficient counts the number of shared
alleles across loci. It can only be applied to homozygous inbred lines, i.e. only genotypes 0 and 2.
To account for loci that are alike in state but not identical by descent (IBD),  Hayes and Goddard
(2008) correct the simple matching coefficient by the minimum of observed simple matching
coefficients \deqn{\frac{s-s_{min}}{1-s_{min}}}{s-smin/(1-smin)} where \eqn{s} is the matrix of
simple matching coefficients. This formula is used with argument \code{ret="sm-smin"}.

If \code{ret="gaussian"}, the euklidian distances \code{distEuk} for all individuals are calculated.
The values of \code{distEuk} are than used to calculate similarity coefficients between the
individuals with \code{exp(distEuk^2/numMarker)}. Be aware that this relationship matrix scales
theoretically between 0 and 1!
