\title{
Read data of a vcf-file to a matrix
}
\description{
Function for easily read genomic data in vcf-Format to a list, which contains the map information and the marker information.
}
\usage{
read.vcf2list(file, FORMAT = "GT", coding = c("allele", "ref"), IDinRow = TRUE, cores=1)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{file}{
\code{character}. The name of the file which the data are to be read from.
}
  \item{FORMAT}{
\code{character}. The default is \code{"GT"}. If there are more formats in your vcf-file you can
decide which one you like to have in your output matrix.
}
  \item{coding}{
This option has only an effect with \code{FORMAT="GT"}. \code{allele} gives you back the alles as
defined as REF and ALT in your vcf-file. \code{ref} gives you back \code{"0"} for the reference
allele and \code{"1"} for the alternative allele.
}
  \item{IDinRow}{
\code{logical}. Default is \code{TRUE}, this means the genotypes are in the rows and the markers in
the column. For \code{FALSE} it is the other way round.
}
  \item{cores}{
\code{numeric}. Specifies the number of cores for parallel computing.
}
}
 \value{
A list with a matrix (\code{\link[base]{matrix}}) containing a representation of the genotypic data in the file and a map of classes GenMap and data.frame.
