	abstract = {Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques will make dense marker maps available and genotyping many individuals for these markers feasible. Here we attempted to estimate the effects of [{\textasciitilde}]50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 {cM} was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 {cM.} The markers surrounding every {1-cM} region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to finite population size {(Ne} = 100), the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the {QTL} located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each {1-cM} chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},

	title = {Prospects for Genomewide Selection for Quantitative Traits in Maize},
	volume = {47},
	abstract = {The availability of cheap and abundant molecular markers in maize {(Zea} mays L.) has allowed breeders to ask how molecular markers may best be used to achieve breeding progress, without conditioning the question on how breeding has traditionally been done. Genomewide selection refers to marker-based selection without first identifying a subset of markers with significant effects. Our objectives were to assess the response due to genomewide selection compared with marker-assisted recurrent selection {(MARS)} and to determine the extent to which phenotyping can be minimized and genotyping maximized in genomewide selection. We simulated genomewide selection by evaluating doubled haploids for testcross performance in Cycle 0, followed by two cycles of selection based on markers. Individuals were genotyped for {NM} markers, and breeding values associated with each of the {NM} markers were predicted and were all used in genomewide selection. We found that across different numbers of quantitative trait loci (20, 40, and 100) and levels of heritability, the response to genomewide selection was 18 to 43\% larger than the response to {MARS.} Responses to selection were maintained when the number of doubled haploids phenotyped and genotyped in Cycle 0 was reduced and the number of plants genotyped in Cycles 1 and 2 was increased. Such schemes that minimize phenotyping and maximize genotyping would be feasible only if the cost per marker data point is reduced to about 2 cents. The convenient but incorrect assumption of equal marker variances led to only a minimal loss in the response to genomewide selection. We conclude that genomewide selection, as a brute-force and black-box procedure that exploits cheap and abundant molecular markers, is superior to {MARS} in maize.},

	volume = {161},
	abstract = {Abstract  Best linear unbiased prediction {(BLUP)} is a standard method for estimating random effects of a mixed model. This method was
originally developed in animal breeding for estimation of breeding values and is now widely used in many areas of research.
It does not, however, seem to have gained the same popularity in plant breeding and variety testing as it has in animal breeding.
In plants, application of mixed models with random genetic effects has up until recently been mainly restricted to the estimation
of genetic and non-genetic components of variance, whereas estimation of genotypic values is mostly based on a model with
fixed effects. This paper reviews recent developments in the application of {BLUP} in plant breeding and variety testing. These
include the use of pedigree information to model and exploit genetic correlation among relatives and the use of flexible variance–covariance
structures for genotype-by-environment interaction. We demonstrate that {BLUP} has good predictive accuracy compared to other
procedures. While pedigree information is often included via the so-called numerator relationship matrix {\$\$({{\textbackslash}user2{A}})\$\$,} we stress that it is frequently straightforward to exploit the same information by a simple mixed model without explicit
reference to the {\$\${{\textbackslash}user2{A}}\$\$-matrix.}},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:In the analysis of complex traits, genetic effects can be confounded with non-genetic effects, especially when using full-sib families. Dominance and epistatic effects are typically confounded with additive genetic and non-genetic effects. This confounding may cause the estimated genetic variance components to be inaccurate and biased.METHODS:In this study, we constructed genetic covariance structures from whole-genome marker data, and thus used realized relationship matrices to estimate variance components in a heterogenous population of ~ 2200 mice for which four complex traits were investigated. These mice were genotyped for more than 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and the variances due to family, cage and genetic effects were estimated by models based on pedigree information only, aggregate SNP information, and model selection for specific SNP effects.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:We show that the use of genome-wide SNP information can disentangle confounding factors to estimate genetic variances by separating genetic and non-genetic effects. The estimated variance components using realized relationship were more accurate and less biased, compared to those based on pedigree information only. Models that allow the selection of individual SNP in addition to fitting a relationship matrix are more efficient for traits with a significant dominance variance.},
