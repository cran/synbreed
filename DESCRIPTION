Description: The package was developed within the Synbreed project for
        synergistic plant and animal breeding (www.synbreed.tum.de). It
        contains a collection of functions required for genomic
        prediction in both plant and animal breeding. This covers data
        processing, data visualization and analysis. All functions are
        embedded within the framework of a single, unified data object.
        The implementation is flexible with respect to a wide range of
        data formats. This research was funded by the German Federal
        Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the
        AgroClustEr Synbreed - Synergistic plant and animal breeding
        (FKZ 0315528A).
