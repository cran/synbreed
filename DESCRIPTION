Description: The package 'synbreed' was developed within the Synbreed project for synergistic plant and animal breeding (www.synbreed.tum.de). It contains a collection of functions required for genomic prediction in both plant and animal breeding. This covers data processing, data visualization and analysis. All functions are embedded within the framework of a single, unified data object. The implementation is flexible with respect to a wide range of data formats. This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the AgroClustEr Synbreed - Synergistic plant and animal breeding (FKZ 0315528A).
