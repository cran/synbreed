Description: A collection of functions required for genomic prediction which were developed within the Synbreed project for synergistic plant and animal breeding (<http://www.synbreed.tum.de>). This covers data processing, data visualization, and analysis. All functions are embedded within the framework of a single, unified data object. The implementation is flexible with respect to a wide range of data formats in plant and animal breeding. This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the AgroClustEr Synbreed - Synergistic plant and animal breeding (FKZ 0315528A).
